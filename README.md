# SnakesandLadders
"Snakes and Ladders" is a classic board game played on a square grid. Players take turns rolling a dice and moving their game piece along numbered squares. The goal is to reach the highest number on the grid. Ladders allow players to climb ahead, while landing on a snake sends them backward. The first player to reach the final square wins.
